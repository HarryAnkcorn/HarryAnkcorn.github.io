<h1>Welcome</h1>

<body>I am a recent graduate of an intensive training course in data engineering provided by Generation UK and looking for my first role 
    in tech. Data analytics has been become an important aspect for all companies and I find the process of extracting valuable conclusions 
    really interesting.<br>

<h1>Skills</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>AWS</li>

    <p style="float: left;"><img src="pipeline.jpeg" alt="pipeline" width="537" height="238"></p>
    <body>As part of the Generartion data engineering program, our final project was to build a data pipeline to extract transaction data
        from a simulated cafes and transorm and load the raw data into 2 seperate tables for business analysis. We used S3, Lambda, SQS, 
        Redshift and Quicksight<br><br><br><br></body>

    <p style="float: left;"><img src="plot.png" alt="plot" width="537"></p>
    <body>After finishing the generation course, I wanted to see the most commom skills mentioned in job applicatios. This webscrapping program
        samples the 25 most relivant junoir data engineers listed on LinkedIn and tallies the skills in a csv file. The data is then plotted
        with matplotlib This all runs on AWS lambda and sorts the csv file, graph image and approved list of words on a s3 bucket. This graph is 
        updated everyday with latest data with a shell script that runs locally on my computer. <br><br><br><br></body>

    <body>As part of the Generartion data engineering program, our first program assigned people and drinks using classes. Through CLI, the user 
        could add/ remover poeple and drinks and have people order a round of drinks that was saved to a MYSQL database. This data is then used to
        produce a verity of graphs using matplotlib</body>
